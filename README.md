# ReguBac
ReguBac is a web-based tool for bacterial gene regulatory network construction integrating RegulonDB, PROKKA, and ABRicate with CARD. It enables automated genome-wide regulatory analysis, AMR gene detection, and interactive visualization of chromosomal and plasmid networks to study resistance mechanisms and regulatory interactions.
